/*
A "constant class" in Java is a class that is specifically designed to hold constant values,
        typically achieved by declaring variables within the class using the static final keywords,
meaning the values assigned to these variables cannot be changed once set and are accessible without
creating an instance of the class; essentially, it serves as a central location to store fixed values
used throughout your application, promoting code readability and maintainability. */


/*
Enum  An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants
        (unchangeable variables, like final variables).*/
